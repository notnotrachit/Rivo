# Rivo - Social Payments on Solana

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Rivo** is a revolutionary social payment ecosystem built on Solana that transforms how people send and receive cryptocurrency. By bridging social media identities with blockchain wallets, Rivo makes crypto payments as intuitive as tagging someone in a post.

### The Problem

Cryptocurrency adoption faces a critical UX barrier: **wallet addresses**. A 44-character alphanumeric string like `7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU` is:

- ‚ùå Impossible to remember
- ‚ùå Easy to mistype (one wrong character = lost funds)
- ‚ùå Not human-readable
- ‚ùå Creates friction in peer-to-peer payments
- ‚ùå Intimidating for non-crypto users

This fundamental UX problem prevents mainstream adoption and limits crypto to tech-savvy users.

### Our Solution

Rivo eliminates wallet addresses entirely by using **social media handles** as payment identifiers. The platform consists of:

1. **Web Dashboard** - Link social accounts, connect wallets, claim escrow funds
2. **Mobile App** (React Native) - Full dashboard + send payments via share functionality
3. **Browser Extension** (Chrome/Firefox) - Send USDC directly from Twitter profiles
4. **Smart Contract** (Solana Program) - On-chain social linking and escrow system

#### Platform Architecture

**Dashboard (Web + Mobile App):**

- Link Twitter account to Solana wallet
- Connect and manage wallets
- View pending escrow claims
- Claim accumulated USDC
- View transaction history
- Account management

**Payment Methods:**

- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop/Laptop**: Browser extension adds "Send USDC" button on Twitter profiles
- üì± **Mobile**: Share Twitter profile to Rivo app for instant payments

#### Core Innovation: Social-to-Wallet Mapping

- Users link their Twitter handle to their Solana wallet **on-chain** (via web or app)
- Anyone can send USDC using `@username` instead of wallet addresses
- **Escrow system** holds funds for unlinked users until they claim
- Multiple social platforms supported (Twitter now, Instagram/LinkedIn coming soon)

#### Key Differentiators

- ‚úÖ **No wallet address needed** - Use @handles you already know
- ‚úÖ **Works with unlinked users** - Send now, they claim later (unique escrow feature)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-platform** - Mobile app + browser extension
- ‚úÖ **Native mobile experience** - Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter integration
- ‚úÖ **Fast & cheap** - Solana's speed and low fees
- ‚úÖ **Open source** - Transparent and community-driven
